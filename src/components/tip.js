           <p>We all love you and we are here to make sure you smile all the time,
              Happiness is the strongest weapon to get over anything you are going through.</p>
           <p>Life is not fair to anybody, you just have to get stronger and brave as going gets tougher.
              God is bigger the oppsositions and the problems, he will definitely see you through them as long as 
              you put your faith in him alone. Don't look at the size of the oppsositions or the problems rather look at the size of God </p>
